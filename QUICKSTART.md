# Jarvis AI Assistant - Quick Start Guide

## 🎯 What's Been Set Up

Your Jarvis AI Assistant project is now ready for development! Here's what has been installed and configured:

### ✅ **Working Components**

1. **Core Services** (All Building Successfully)
   - ✅ GuardRail Service - Security and action approval
   - ✅ Skill Manager - Plugin system framework
   - ✅ Text-to-Speech - Windows SAPI implementation
   - ✅ Input Control - Mouse and keyboard control via Win32 API
   - ✅ Placeholder Hotword Service - Ready for Porcupine integration
   - ✅ Placeholder STT Service - Ready for Whisper integration

2. **Project Structure**
   - ✅ 6 main projects (Core, Audio, Input, AI, Capture, UI)
   - ✅ 2 test projects
   - ✅ 1 test console application
   - ✅ All NuGet packages installed
   - ✅ Configuration system ready

3. **Documentation**
   - ✅ README.md with project overview
   - ✅ PROJECT_STATUS.md with detailed status
   - ✅ Models README with setup instructions
   - ✅ .gitignore configured

### 🔧 **Fixed Issues**

- ✅ Updated ImageSharp to address vulnerabilities
- ✅ Fixed test project references
- ✅ Fixed nullable reference warnings
- ✅ Simplified Input project to remove WinUI dependency
- ✅ Added platform-specific annotations

### 📦 **Build Status**

Successfully building:
- ✅ Jarvis.Core
- ✅ Jarvis.Audio (with TTS implementation)
- ✅ Jarvis.Input (Win32 input control)
- ✅ Jarvis.AI
- ✅ Jarvis.TestConsole

Requires Visual Studio 2022:
- ⚠️ Jarvis.UI (WinUI 3 app)
- ⚠️ Jarvis.Capture (Windows.Graphics.Capture)

## 🚀 **Quick Test**

Run the test console to verify everything works:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\don_t\Desktop\Projects\Jarvis
dotnet run --project src/Jarvis.TestConsole
```

This will test:
- Text-to-Speech (will speak!)
- GuardRail security checks
- Input control (mouse movement)
- Placeholder services

## 📋 **Next Steps**

### Immediate (Before Coding)

1. **Download Hotword Model**
   - Go to https://console.picovoice.ai/
   - Create free account
   - Create "Hey Jarvis" wake word
   - Download .ppn file to `models/hotword.ppn`

2. **Install Ollama (Optional for local AI)**
   ```powershell
   # Download from https://ollama.ai/
   ollama pull llama3.2
   ```

3. **Get API Keys (If using cloud LLM)**
   - OpenAI API key for GPT-4
   - or Anthropic for Claude
   - or xAI for Grok
   - Update `config/appsettings.json`

### Development Priority

**Phase 1: Core Audio Pipeline** (Week 1)
- [ ] Integrate Picovoice Porcupine for hotword
- [ ] Integrate Faster-Whisper for STT
- [ ] Test full audio pipeline (wake word → listen → transcribe)

**Phase 2: Screen & Vision** (Week 2)
- [ ] Implement Windows.Graphics.Capture (requires Visual Studio)
- [ ] Add OCR service (Windows.Media.Ocr)
- [ ] Test screen capture and analysis

**Phase 3: AI Integration** (Week 3)
- [ ] Implement LLM service (Ollama or API)
- [ ] Add action parsing logic
- [ ] Create basic skills (notepad, browser control)

**Phase 4: UI & Polish** (Week 4)
- [ ] Build WinUI app in Visual Studio
- [ ] Add approval dialogs
- [ ] System tray integration
- [ ] Settings window

## 🛠️ **Development Commands**

```powershell
# Restore packages
dotnet restore

# Build all (except WinUI projects)
dotnet build

# Build specific project
dotnet build src/Jarvis.Core/Jarvis.Core.csproj

# Run test console
dotnet run --project src/Jarvis.TestConsole

# Run tests
dotnet test

# Clean build
dotnet clean
```

## 📝 **Important Files**

- `config/appsettings.json` - Configuration (API keys, settings)
- `models/` - AI models directory
- `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md` - Detailed project status
- `src/Jarvis.Core/Interfaces/IServices.cs` - Service contracts
- `src/Jarvis.Core/Models/Models.cs` - Data models

## ⚠️ **Known Limitations**

1. **WinUI Projects** - Need Visual Studio 2022 to build:
   - Jarvis.UI (main application)
   - Jarvis.Capture (screen capture)
   
   Command-line build will fail for these.

2. **Placeholder Services**
   - Hotword detection is simulated
   - STT is simulated
   - You need to integrate real implementations

3. **No Skills Yet**
   - Skill system is ready
   - No concrete skills implemented
   - You need to create skills

## 🎓 **Architecture Overview**

```

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

**Q: Build fails with WinUI errors?**
A: Open the solution in Visual Studio 2022. Command-line builds don't support WinUI without build tools.

**Q: Speech doesn't work?**
A: Make sure your audio devices are working. Check Windows Sound settings.

**Q: How do I add a new skill?**
A: Implement `ISkill` interface and register with `SkillManager`. See examples in docs.

**Q: Where are the AI models?**
A: Run `scripts\download-models.ps1` for instructions.

## ✅ **You're Ready!**

Everything is set up and ready to go. The core framework is complete, services are implemented, and you have a working test console.

Start by running the test console to see it in action, then begin implementing the real hotword and STT services!
