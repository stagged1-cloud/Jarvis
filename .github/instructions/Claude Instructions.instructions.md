Use the below info as a guide only, not specific to all chats, but only when applicable, ignore the balnks until you think it may fit, but ask me anyway.

Only make the exact changes I requestâ€”do not modify, remove, or alter any other code, styling, or page elements unless explicitly instructed. If my request conflicts with existing code or functionality, pause and ask for confirmation before proceeding. Always follow this rule.

Before you generate any code, explain exactly what you plan to do. Include affected files, components, and edge cases. Wait for my confirmation before proceeding.
