# ðŸŽ¯ FIRST STEPS - Hotword Detection Implementation

## âœ… What We Just Did

1. âœ… Tested all working services (TTS, Security, Input Control)
2. âœ… Installed Porcupine package (v3.0.10)
3. âœ… Created `PorcupineHotwordService.cs` with real Porcupine integration

## ðŸ”´ What You Need to Do NOW

### Step 1: Get Picovoice Access Key (5 minutes)

1. Go to **https://console.picovoice.ai/**
2. Sign up for a **free account**
3. Copy your **Access Key** from the dashboard
4. Save it - you'll need it in the next step

### Step 2: Create Custom Wake Word (5 minutes)

1. In Picovoice Console, go to **"Porcupine"**
2. Click **"Create a Wake Word"**
3. Type: **"Hey Jarvis"** or **"Jarvis"**
4. Train and download the `.ppn` file
5. Save it to: `C:\Users\don_t\Desktop\Projects\Jarvis\models\hotword.ppn`

### Step 3: Update Configuration

Update `config/appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "Jarvis": {
    "Audio": {
      "HotwordModelPath": "models/hotword.ppn",
      "PicovoiceAccessKey": "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_HERE",
      ...
```

Add the `PicovoiceAccessKey` field with your access key from Step 1.

### Step 4: Add Audio Capture

The `PorcupineHotwordService` is ready but needs audio input. We need to:

1. **Install NAudio** for microphone access
2. **Implement audio capture** in the hotword service
3. **Process audio frames** with Porcupine

Let me know when you have:
- âœ… Your Picovoice access key
- âœ… The hotword.ppn file downloaded

Then I'll implement the audio capture part!

## ðŸ“‹ Current Status

**Working:**
- âœ… TTS (speaks)
- âœ… Security (guardrails)
- âœ… Input control (mouse/keyboard)
- âœ… Porcupine SDK installed
- âœ… Service structure ready

**Next:**
- ðŸ”² Get access key
- ðŸ”² Download hotword model
- ðŸ”² Implement audio capture
- ðŸ”² Test real hotword detection

## ðŸš€ After Hotword Works

Once we have hotword detection working, the next priorities are:

1. **Speech-to-Text** (Faster-Whisper integration)
2. **Screen Capture** (Windows.Graphics.Capture)
3. **LLM Integration** (Ollama or API)
4. **First Working Skill** (Open Notepad)

## ðŸ’¡ Quick Test Available

While waiting for your access key, you can still test:

```powershell
# Run test console (uses placeholder services)
dotnet run --project src/Jarvis.TestConsole

# Build everything
dotnet build
```
